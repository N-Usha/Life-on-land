Cerrado has an aquatic biome that is probably the most important of all the biomes. The biome contains the headwaters and the largest portion of South American watersheds. e Cerradoas rivers basins have been highly impacted by extreme deforestation, expansion of the agricultural and cattle ranching frontier, construction of dams, and extraction of water for irrigation
